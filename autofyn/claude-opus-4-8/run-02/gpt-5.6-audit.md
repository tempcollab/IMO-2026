# GPT-5.6 audit of `autofyn/claude-opus-4-8/run-02`

## Scope and grading standard

I audited the selected `current.md` in each of
`results/imo-2026/autofyn/claude-opus-4-8/run-02/problem-01` through
`problem-06` against the corresponding statements in `problems.jsonl`. I
also inspected the promoted lemmas on which the selected proofs rely. For
Problem 2 I read and executed both supplied symbolic artifacts in
`problem-02/code/` with bytecode writing disabled.

The Autofyn status labels, internal reviewer approvals, and random tests were
not accepted as proof. Code-assisted proof is allowed when the code provides
an exact, reproducible certificate. Numerical experiments alone receive no
credit.

I use the requested strict completion-based standard: a complete proof, or
one requiring only a genuinely tiny local repair, receives 7. A solution
missing a load-bearing direction or lemma receives 0 rather than an invented
partial score.

## Problem 1 — 7/7

### Structure of the proof

For each prime `p`, a move on two entries induces

\[
(a,b)\longmapsto(\min(a,b),|a-b|)
\]

on their `p`-adic valuations. The Euclidean identity

\[
\gcd(\min(a,b),|a-b|)=\gcd(a,b)
\]

therefore preserves the gcd `g_p` of the entire valuation list.

Termination is proved using the lexicographic monovariant

\[
\left(\Omega_{\rm tot},C\right)
=\left(\sum_i\Omega(x_i),\#\{i:x_i>1\}\right).
\]

When the chosen entries have nontrivial gcd, `Omega_tot` decreases. When
they are coprime, the chosen pair becomes `(1,mn)`, so `Omega_tot` stays
fixed while `C` decreases. Thus every play terminates.

At termination `C<=1`. An all-ones board is excluded by choosing a prime
dividing an initial entry and using the positive invariant `g_p`. Hence
exactly one nonunit `M` remains, and

\[
v_p(M)=\gcd_i v_p(x_i^{\rm init})
\]

for every prime. This determines `M` independently of the move sequence.

### Skeptical checks

- The valuation of `lcm(m,n)/gcd(m,n)` is correctly `|a-b|`.
- The gcd convention correctly includes zero valuations and the all-zero
  list.
- The exact change in `Omega_tot` is
  `-Omega(gcd(m,n))`, so there is no missing non-coprime equality case.
- Lexicographic descent in `N x N` is well-founded; it proves finite
  termination, not merely absence of a cycle.
- The all-ones contradiction is sound: a nonzero finite list of
  nonnegative valuations has positive gcd under the stated convention.
- Only finitely many primes appear, so the final product is an ordinary
  finite integer product.

The alternative confluence proof and the simulations are unnecessary. The
selected valuation proof is self-contained.

**Verdict: complete, 7/7.**

## Problem 2 — 7/7

### Geometric reduction

The proof normalizes

\[
B=(0,0),\quad C=(a,0),\quad A=(p,q),\quad a,q>0,
\]

and obtains

\[
OM=ON\iff O_x=\frac{2p+a}{4}.
\]

Writing `theta=angle KBA=angle ACL` and
`s=tan(theta/2)`, it parametrizes `K` on the clockwise rotation of ray
`BA` and `L` on the counterclockwise rotation of ray `CA`. The positive
ray parameters are denoted `t_K,t_L`.

The other two angle equalities become polynomial equations

\[
E_2=t_KH(t_L)=0,
\qquad
E_3=t_LG(t_K)=0.
\]

Since both ray parameters are positive, the hypotheses yield
`G(t_K)=H(t_L)=0`. The target circumcenter equation has polynomial numerator
`T`, and the proof supplies the exact cofactor identity

\[
fT=Q_GG+Q_HH,
\]

where the cofactors are genuine polynomials and

\[
f=(1+s^2)|AB||AC|\sin(\angle A+\theta)>0.
\]

It follows that `T=0`.

### Branch and orientation checks

The use of unsigned angle equalities is legitimate. The solution derives the
orientations of all four rays from the triangle- and angle-containment
hypotheses:

- `K` lies clockwise of `BA`, while `L` lies counterclockwise of `CA`;
- `delta(L-B,K-B)=angle LBK` lies in `(0,pi)`;
- `delta(L-N,C-N)=angle LNC` lies in `(0,pi)`;
- `delta(L-C,K-C)=angle LCK` lies in `(0,pi)`; and
- `delta(B-M,K-M)=angle BMK` lies in `(0,pi)`.

Thus the sine-difference equations encode equality, not the supplementary
branch. Their differences lie in `(-pi,pi)`, where a zero sine forces the
difference itself to be zero.

The final scalar is also safely divisible. Because `K` is strictly inside
triangle `BMC`,

\[
0<\theta<\angle ABC.
\]

Hence

\[
0<\angle A+\theta
<\angle A+\angle ABC
=\pi-\angle ACB<\pi,
\]

so `f>0`. The circumcenter denominator is nonzero because `AKL` is a
nondegenerate triangle.

### Exact code certificate

`problem-02/code/verify.py` reconstructs all coordinates and vector
polynomials directly. It then:

1. checks that `E2/t_K` depends only on `t_L` and `E3/t_L` only on `t_K`;
2. divides the target polynomial by `G,H`;
3. verifies the rational cofactor residual exactly;
4. clears the common denominator and verifies the polynomial identity;
5. checks that the cleared cofactors have denominator 1; and
6. verifies the geometric formula for `f`.

I executed it. Its decisive exact outputs were:

```text
remainder after reducing T mod <G,H> : 0
EXACT cofactor check  T-(qG*G+qH*H) = 0
c - f  = 0
EXACT polynomial identity  f*T-(QG*G+QH*H) = 0
f - (1+s^2)*AB*AC*sin(A+theta) = 0
```

The companion sign script reproduced the two simple manifestly positive
cross products. The proof's remaining orientation signs are established
geometrically in the text and do not depend on that script.

This is a valid exact certificate. No generic-parameter exception or hidden
division by zero remains.

**Verdict: complete, 7/7.**

## Problem 3 — 0/7

### Correct reduction and completed direction

The submission identifies

\[
c(n)=\frac{2^n}{2^{n+1}-1}.
\]

It contains substantial correct work:

- the claiming stage is reduced to the alternating sum of the sorted final
  piece lengths;
- the full general upper bound is proved by a signed-sum realizability
  argument and subset-sum pigeonhole;
- the dyadic opening is reduced to the scaled discrepancy target
  `D_tilde >= 1`; and
- the extremal base slice and all uncut-top-rung cases in the proposed
  lower-bound induction are proved.

The upper bound is a genuine theorem. The realizability construction uses at
most `n` physical cuts, and the subset-sum gap supplies the required signed
pattern with discrepancy at most `1/(2^{n+1}-1)`.

### The unresolved lower-bound endpoint

To finish the lower bound, the proof must show that every legal Xiang Yu
refinement of the dyadic ladder has scaled alternating sum at least 1. It
organizes the remaining work as a budget-aware mutual induction on a red
partition `R` and a refined dyadic ladder `F'`. The uncut-top-rung branch and
the cut-top-rung subcase `sum(R) <= theta` are closed.

The final general-`b` lift is nevertheless not proved. After reducing to the
integer-rigid endpoint `sum(R)=2^m`, the file explicitly leaves two
cut-top-rung leaves open:

- the all-red-parts-at-most-`theta` endpoint inherited from the auxiliary
  `Q_hat_(m-1)` statement; and
- the corresponding overlap inequality in the cut branch, where the odd-set
  intersection term can attain the tight value.

These are load-bearing cases of the induction, not boundary bookkeeping.
The conditional inheritance and extensive exact tests cannot substitute for
the missing inequalities. The selected `current.md` accordingly retains
status `partial` and states that the whole problem remains open until those
endpoint leaves are closed.

Thus the claimed equality is missing its general lower-bound direction.
Under a granular olympiad marking scheme the completed upper bound and the
lower-bound reductions would merit substantial partial credit, but this
completion-based audit assigns no credit to an incomplete solution.

**Verdict: incomplete, 0/7.**

## Problem 4 — 7/7

### Characterization

\[
\boxed{\theta=\frac{180^\circ}{n}\quad(n\ge2\text{ an integer}).}
\]

### Nonresonant direction

A triangle is called good if none of its angles is an integral multiple of
`theta`. With a cut at an angle `alpha` and parameter `x`, the two children
are

\[
(x,\beta,180^\circ-\beta-x),
\qquad
(\alpha-x,\gamma,\beta+x).
\]

Modulo `theta`, the first child can be bad only when

\[
x\equiv0
\quad\text{or}\quad
x\equiv180^\circ-\beta,
\]

and the second only when

\[
x\equiv\alpha
\quad\text{or}\quad
x\equiv-\beta.
\]

An intersection of those two bad sets would force one current angle to be
zero modulo `theta`, or force `180 degrees` itself to be zero modulo
`theta`. Both are excluded for a good triangle when
`180 degrees/theta` is nonintegral. Hence Shan-Yu can always retain a good
child.

A good starting triangle exists because only finitely many values in a
one-parameter isosceles family make one of its three angles a multiple of
`theta`. Thus Shan-Yu can avoid `theta` forever.

### Resonant direction

Let `180 degrees=n theta`. If a triangle has an angle `m theta`, repeatedly
cutting that vertex peels the multiplier down; one child contains `theta`
and the other contains `(m-1)theta`, eventually giving a double fork.

If no angle is initially a multiple, cut from a largest angle. The angle at
the cut point sweeps an open interval of length equal to that largest angle.
For `n>=3` this interval has length greater than `theta`, so it contains a
multiple `k theta`; its supplementary cut-point angle is
`(n-k)theta`. For `n=2`, the altitude from the largest vertex makes both
cut-point angles 90 degrees. Thus whichever child Shan-Yu keeps contains a
positive proper multiple of `theta`, and the peel finishes.

### Skeptical checks

- Every parameter in `(0,alpha)` is realized by a legal point on the open
  opposite side.
- In the interval argument, equality of the largest angle with `theta` is
  either already a win or, for the only possible boundary `theta=60
  degrees`, forces the equilateral winning position. Hence the interval is
  sufficiently long in every live case.
- The modulo argument is symmetric in the attacked vertex.
- The game checks for `theta` before the next move, so a child containing
  `theta` is an immediate loss for Shan-Yu and the forcing language is
  valid.

Both directions and all values `0<theta<180 degrees` are covered.

**Verdict: complete, 7/7.**

## Problem 5 — 7/7

### Functional identity and orbits

Substituting `x=f(y)` squeezes the middle expression between two copies of
`f(y)`, giving

\[
f(f(y))=2f(y)-y.
\]

Writing `g(y)=f(y)-y`, this implies that `g` is constant along every forward
orbit and

\[
f^n(y)=y+ng(y).
\]

Positivity of all iterates forces `g(y)>=0`.

### Equality of positive orbit gaps

Suppose `g(a)=alpha>0` and `g(b)=beta>0`. The proof selects far-out points

\[
x_k=a+k\alpha
\]

on the first orbit and nearest points

\[
y_k=b+m_k\beta
\]

on the second, so `|x_k-y_k|<=beta/2`. Applying the squared lower inequality
to `(x_k,y_k)` yields the exact residual

\[
4x_k(\alpha-\beta)+(\alpha-d_k)^2\ge0,
\qquad d_k=x_k-y_k.
\]

The square is bounded. If `alpha<beta`, the first term tends to negative
infinity, a contradiction. Reversing the two orbits gives
`beta>=alpha`, so all positive values of `g` equal one constant `c`.

### Excluding fixed/translated mixing

If `t` is fixed and `b` has positive gap `c`, the squared upper inequality
at `(b,t)` gives

\[
(b-t)^2\ge 2c(b+t)+c^2>c^2.
\]

Therefore every point within distance `c` of a fixed point is also fixed.
Starting from one fixed point and walking to any positive target in finitely
many subintervals of length at most `c` shows that every positive real is
fixed. Hence a function cannot mix fixed points with translated orbits.

Consequently either `g=0` or `g=c>0` everywhere, so
`f(x)=x+c`, `c>=0`. Direct expansion shows that for these functions both
squared inequalities differ by

\[
(x-y-c)^2\ge0.
\]

### Skeptical checks

- The nearest-orbit index `m_k` is nonnegative for all sufficiently large
  `k`; ignoring finitely many earlier `k` is harmless.
- The nearest-lattice-point error is uniformly bounded, exactly what the
  limit argument requires.
- The symmetric comparison uses the same argument with the roles swapped.
- The no-mixing stepping argument stays inside the positive real interval.
- No continuity, measurability, monotonicity, or surjectivity is assumed.

The proof is complete.

**Verdict: complete, 7/7.**

## Problem 6 — 7/7

### Static admissible set and periodicity machine

Let

\[
\mathcal A=\{x>1:\gcd(x,a_i)>1\text{ for every }i\ge1\}.
\]

The preliminary lemmas correctly show that the sequence is the increasing
enumeration of `A intersect [a_1,infinity)`. Every multiple of
`rad(a_1)` lies in `A`, giving bounded gaps and unboundedness.

If a finite prime set `S` hits every pair of distinct terms and

\[
L=\prod_{p\in S}p,
\]

then membership in `A` above `a_1` is determined solely by which primes in
`S` divide the integer. It is therefore periodic modulo `L`. Enumerating the
good residue classes in one interval of length `L` gives

\[
a_{n+T}=a_n+L
\]

from `n=1`, where `T` is the number of admissible integers in that interval.

I checked the small self-pair detail in this reduction. When the candidate
`x=a_k` is compared with itself, one may use any other term `a_j`; the
hitting prime of the pair `(a_k,a_j)` divides `a_k`, and therefore also
certifies the self-comparison. The infinite sequence supplies such another
term.

### The small-prime spine

The central new claim is:

> Any two distinct terms share a prime at most `a_1`.

Every term has at least one such small prime because it shares a factor with
`a_1`. For a term `b`, let `alpha` be the product of its distinct small prime
factors. The compression step constructs an integer `x` satisfying

\[
a_1\le x\le b
\]

whose prime support is exactly the small-prime support of `b`.

The only delicate bound occurs when `b` also has a big prime `q>a_1`.
Choosing a small factor `p|b` and minimal `N` with
`p^N alpha>=a_1` gives, for `N>=1`,

\[
x=p^N\alpha<p\,a_1\le\alpha a_1<\alpha q\le b.
\]

Every inequality is justified: `p<=alpha`, `q>a_1`, and the squarefree
product `alpha q` divides `b`.

Now suppose a violating pair `b<b'` shares no small prime and choose one
with `b'` minimal. The compressed `x` of `b` is coprime to `b'` and lies in
`[a_1,b]`. It cannot be a term, since every two terms have gcd greater than
one. The greedy bridge therefore produces an earlier term `b*<x` coprime to
`x`. Yet `b` and `b*` must share some prime. Such a common prime cannot be
small, because every small prime of `b` divides `x`; hence `(b,b*)` is
another violating pair with maximum below `b'`, contradicting minimality.

Thus the finite set of all primes at most `a_1` is a hitting set, and the
periodicity machine completes the proof.

### Skeptical checks

- The bridge “`n` is a term iff it meets every earlier term” follows
  directly from the greedy minimality rule and strict increase.
- The compression integer never introduces a new prime and always remains
  in the domain `x>=a_1` needed by the bridge.
- If `x=b`, the new witness still satisfies `b*<b`, so the descent remains
  strict.
- A violating pair may share big primes; the descent needs only the absence
  of shared small primes and handles that definition correctly.
- The admissible-set periodicity is two-sided above the cutoff: for
  `y>=a_1+L`, subtracting `L` stays above `a_1`, so translation by `L` is an
  order-preserving bijection of the relevant tails.
- `T>=1` because `a_1` itself is admissible.

No conditional hypothesis remains.

**Verdict: complete, 7/7.**

## Final coordinator-style assessment

Problems 1, 4, 5, and 6 are complete human-readable proofs. Problem 2 is
also complete: its exact symbolic identity is reproducibly checked from raw
coordinates, and the text proves all orientation and positivity conditions
needed to apply it.

Problem 3 is the sole incomplete submission. Its general upper bound and much
of its lower-bound induction are valuable, but two cut-top-rung endpoint
leaves remain open in the general lower-bound lift. The file does not pretend
that the conditional induction has closed those cases.

**Final score: 35/42.**
